          <p>Embik is a privately owned limited liability company with strong social objectives
that was registered in January 1997 to formalize the agricultural ventures which
some members of the Chibsah family of Old Tafo, Kumasi had started in the late
1980s. The main objective of the company was to offer training avenues to the
youth and peasant farmers on a 20 acre farmland at Abrakaso, Agona in the
Ashanti region. Initially, the company concentrated on training in exotic vegetable
production, rabbit breeding, food crops and livestock production. The company,
Embik Ltd, was registered to engage mainly in agricultural production and related
activities.
The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, in the context of a
World Bank Rural Development Programme, designated Embik Farms officially as
a Learning Centre in 2005 to train the youth in theory and in practice in rabbit
breeding and vegetable production. In 2006 and 2007 the British High
Commission, Accra and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
respectively sponsored Embik Farms to train 25 farmers each in rabbit breeding
and vegetable production. Below is a picture of some of the farmers in training.</p>

          <p><a href="#"><img class="speaker" src="images/speakers/bunnies.jpg" alt="Photo of Hillary Goldwynn"></a></p>
          <p>The training was so successfully conducted that in the end it enhanced the
production of rabbits on the farm out of which the trained farmers were given
rabbits and hutches to start their own farms. However, the project encountered a 
3
problem of marketing of over 600 rabbits produced on the farm. Traditionally, the
Ashanti region prefers other kinds of meat such as grass cutters in spite of the fact
that rabbit meat is considered very healthy. Embik was aware that public
education was required to promote marketing of the rabbits but could not obtain
any assistance in this respect and could not finance it alone.
Scarcity of vegetables during the dry season (October â€“ April) induced Embik to
engage in commercial production of dry season vegetables under irrigation in
2010 using River Pratwere on the northern boundary of the farm as a source of
water for irrigation. The vegetables encountered unanticipated production
problems of insect and bacterial attacks which proved resistant to treatment
recommended by specialists. This saw the abrupt end of the rabbit and vegetable
projects. </p>

          <p><a href="#"><img class="speaker" src="images/speakers/poultry.jpg" alt="Photo of Riley Rewington"></a></p>
          <p>In an effort to diversify production in order to discover a more sustainable activity
on the farm, a commercial egg production unit was set up in 2005 with the
procurement d 4,000 day old chicks to start a commercial layers project. The
project performed impressively at the beginning and showed promising signs until
rainstorm destroyed the facilities in 2007. Picture 3 below shows Prince, the
poultry expert at work. Working capital for farm operations which we had hoped could come from
internally generated funds was becoming a serious problem with the failure of the
projects.
Sponsorship for training trickled in at a snail pace which could not save the farm
in terms of its working capital needs. In search of a more dependable activity to
sustain the farm, management established a college with hostel facilities at the
farm in 2007 to provide formal teaching and practical training in agriculture for
the youth. This, it was hoped, would bring in continuous flow of working capital.
By the end of 2009, 15 students had been successfully tutored in National
Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) agricultural programme to the National
Craftsmanship Certificate (NCC) level. The College unfortunately was also
destroyed by rainstorm in 2010.</p>

        <a href="#"><img src="images/misc/technical.jpg"></a>
        <p>Skilled and experienced personnel envisaged in this project are not very common
in the area where the project is being developed. Equipment and other vital
inputs also have to be sourced from either Accra, the national capital or from
outside the country. In terms of technical assistance and knowhow, the Mampong
campus of the University of Education Winneba, which is about 30 km to the
north of the project, provides technical guidance in project implementation under
the directorship of Prof Annor within the context of the EDULINK project.
In spite of the challenges, the stakeholders including Embik, are passionate and
committed enough to see the project through. Pioneers, it is said, are those often
with arrows in their backs. They go through all kinds of challenges but triumph at
last. Embik Farms have had their share of challenges and problems as outlined
above but things seem to be falling in place for the success of the project. In this
connection no assistance, technical, equipment or otherwise is considered small
enough to be rejected. For further information please contact the Director of
Embik Farms Mr. Seidu Chibsah, by email <a href="mailto:sk@embik.com?Subject=technical%20assistance" target="_top">sk@embik.com</a>.</p>

        <h1>Review of Farm Activities</h1>
		        <a href="#"><img src="images/misc/review.jpg"></a>
          <p>The calamities on the farm necessitated a careful review of farm activities for
sustainability. Taking into account soil fertility, topography and the frequency of
rainstorm on one hand and on the other hand the performance of the existing
citrus plantation and the cattle ranch in spite of the comparatively minimum
investment made in these activities, it was decided to put emphasis on tree crops
and cattle. The tree crops would help check the acute problem of soil erosion and
serve as wind breaker. The cattle on the other hand would introduce new
profession in the area and improve the local supply of meat and milk on the
market.

</p>

          <p>With respect to tree crops, management decided on coconut plantation on
account of its current market potential, the possibility of planting cover crop
underneath the coconut trees to serve as pasture for the cattle in addition to
checking soil erosion. With respect to cattle breeding, management planned to
put more emphasis on milk production which is currently in high demand by
manufacturers of yoghurt and provide meat as well. Having brought on board
these two activities, training was relegated to the position where it would be
offered only on demand.</p>

        <h1>Coconut Plantation</h1>
		<a href="#"><img src="images/artwork/01.png"></a>
        <p>In 2012 the management started planting 850 coconut trees some of which have
started bearing fruits as anticipated and shown in Picture 5 below. At this rate it is certain to start full commercial harvest in 2017 as planned and
provide some financial relief for better farm operations.</p>
      </article><!-- article -->

      <article id="whoshouldcome">
        <h1>Livestock Project</h1>
<p>The cattle project is planned to be implemented in 3 phases with a shift of
emphasis from beef to milk production including milk processing.
Phase 1 of the project consists of modifying the existing structures so as to create
two separate sections: breeding and milk production sections. The breeding
section is housed in the existing kraal after renovation to meet planned objective.
Local cows when on heat will be isolated within the kraal in a section created
purposely for that and artificially inseminated with Friesian semen to obtain
crossbred calves. Male calves will be left at the breeding section to be fattened. It
is planned to procure ten oxen every six months to be fattened for the market.
The breeding section will be maintained on free grazing with some feed
supplementation. 
<br /><br />
<a href="#"><img src="images/misc/breeding.png"></a>
The concept of zero grazing has necessitated pasture development on the farm
covering a total of about 8 acres to be managed in a manner that in combination
with feed supplementation and irrigation, there will be grass on the farm all year
round. Three different kinds of grass are available for propagation to provide
variety and improve nutritional content of feed.
The dairy section is already operational with 3 crossbred cows and 1 crossbred
bull (Friesian/local Sanga) purchased from Amrahia Dairy Farm. This is a state
institution setup to assist farmers in this respect. The 4 animals presently on the
farm are a small part of a planned target of between 16 to 20 animals for the
dairy section in Phase 1.
<br /><br />
Management intends to procure pure Jersey breed brought in from South Africa
to cross the Friesian crossbreeds to improve milk yield. The products of
Jersey/Friesian crosses have been recorded to yield 20 litres of milk per day as
compared to the average yield of 15 litres from the Friesian/Sanga crossbreed.
The picture below shows the dairy cows on zero grazing in their kraal. 
<br /><br />
<a href="#"><img src="images/misc/grazing.png"></a>
<strong>Phase 2</strong> of the project will consist of expanding the dairy section with the aim of
producing enough milk on the farm to make it economically worthwhile to engage
in milk processing. Phase 3 will consist of organising a suitable location on the
farm for installation of the necessary machinery and training of personnel
required for the milk processing plant.
<br /><br />
As usual, the management will undertake feasibility studies to test the viability,
profitability and sustainability of the second and third phases before
implementation. Preâ€“investment estimates indicate that the three phases will
cost about USD 400,000 at January 2014 prices over a period of about 10 years
(2014â€“2023). Phase 1 is planned to cost GHc 200,000 as at 2014 prices.
Management was able to raise partial funding in the last quarter of 2014 to start
implementation of Phase 1. Additional funding is urgently required to complete
phase1 of the project.

        <h1> Supplementary Activities</h1>
        <p>Pasture for free grazing is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain due to the
increasing activities of estate developers at the district level where Embik
operates. It is therefore envisaged that in addition to the provision of pasture on
the farm, it will be necessary to put in place systems to prepare feed pellets from
local inputs and hydroponic fodder with the aim that the totality of the animals
on the farm will in the near future be put on zero grazing. The cover crop to be
planted underneath the 8.5 acres of coconut plantation will be of immense value
in this respect.</p> <!--

        <h1>Market Potential</h1>
        <p>FAO statistics in 2010 indicated that cattle population and meat production in
Ghana stood at 1,454,000 and 19,990 metric tons respectively. In the same year
there was an import of beef and buffalo meat to the tune of 15,182.6 metric tons 
9
and over 50,000 live cattle from neighbouring countries. There was no export of
cattle or beef from the country meaning that all cattle produced in the country do
not meet local demand hence the need for imports. Per capita consumption of
fresh milk in Ghana, according to FAO 1999 statistics, is comparatively very low
among African countries as shown below

<dl class="table01">
<dt>Bangladesh</dt>
<dd><div id="data-bangladesh" class="bar"></div></dd>
<dt>Ghana</dt>
<dd><div id="data-ghana" class="bar"></div></dd>
<dt>Kenya</dt>
<dd><div id="data-kenya" class="bar"></div></dd>
<dt>Avg. Sub-Saharan Africa</dt>
<dd><div id="data-africa" class="bar"></div></dd>
<dt>Avg. South Asia</dt>
<dd><div id="data-asia" class="bar"></div></dd>
</dl>

In spite of the low level of consumption, as much as 28,267.5 metric tons of milk
in various forms was imported from Europe and America in the same year.
Conclusively meat and milk demand in Ghana exceeds supply and livestock
farmers should be encouraged and supported to take advantage of the situation
to increase their production levels and still find market. Moreover, this is an
import substitution venture which will save the country some foreign exchange.
